left click: select node
right click on the workspace: options
middle click and drag: pan (move all node)

Zoom:
cursor inside the node + mouse wheel: zoom out/in
cursor inside the workspace + alt/option + mouse wheel: zoom out/in for all nodes

Linking:
No need to drag, left click once in your input or output triangle
and Diamond will draw a link ended at your mouse cursor. 
All you have to do is to move your mouse to the destination and
it will be linked if the types between input and output matches.
P.S. Since you don't need to drag for linking you can use your
middle mouse button to pan and to link with a far node for example.

Moving several nodes:
Left click and drag a rectangle to select nodes,
then hold alt/option key and move your nodes with arrow keys.
