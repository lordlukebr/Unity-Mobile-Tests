Thank you for downloading Diamond
support: support@mezanix.com

To Open Diamond, in the Unity Top Menu, go to:
Tools->Mezanix->Diamond

Local documentation is at:
Assets/Mezanix/Diamond/0_Documentation

Examples are at:
Assets/Mezanix/Diamond/1_Examples


The folder:
Assets/Mezanix/Diamond/Scripts/GlobalScriptsCreatedByDiamond/1_ProjectVariables
contains the script: ProjectVariables.cs 
This script contains static variables, these variables can be used
by the generated scripts. If this script is missing Diamond will
create it at the path mentioned above, so you have to keep the 
'Mezanix' folder at the root of your project (its original place 
as when you imported it).


Here is the web documentation:

You can also access the web documentation by clicking
on the question mark button at the top right of
the Diamond window
